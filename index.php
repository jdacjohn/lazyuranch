  <p class="pBellMTIntro" style="margin-left: -40px;">THIS is a Ranch About the All-American Ranch House.</p>
  
  <p class="pBellMTIntro">John Wayne never owned a ranch. In 1953, Wayne and his new wife, Pilar, moved into a two-story Early American home on a knoll in 
    Encino. It had five acres, stables, and a riding ring, but no horses.</p>

  <p class="pBellMTBody">"Are we going to have horses?" Pilar asked, as she reported in her autobiography.</p>
	<p class="pBellMTBody">"Where'd you get that idea?" countered the world's foremost movie cowboy.</p>
	<p class="pBellMTBody">"From all your westerns. I just assumed you loved to ride."</p>
	<p class="pBellMTBody">"The only time I get on a horse," The Duke replied, "is when I make a movie. I hate the damn things."</p>

	<p class="pBellMTBody">That, in a nutshell, is the story of the American ranch house as written in
  	<a href="http://www.alanhess.net/resources.htm" target="_blank">"RANCHO DELUXE"</a>
  	by <a href="http://www.alanhess.net/resources.htm" target="_blank">Alan Hess</a>. The image of the ranch house overtook the reality long ago. The ranch was once a practical, dusty, unglamorous 
    homestead, a place of hard work and scant leisure. But by the middle of the twentieth century the plain, hard working ranch house 
    of 150 years before had been turned on its head, repackaged as a symbol of relaxation and ease.</p>
    
  <p class="pBellMTBody">It's not often that we get an opportunity to watch a myth develop before our eyes. At this late date we can't know exactly what 
  	refinements and alterations transformed actual experiences into the epics of Homer or the romance of Camelot. But within the memory 
    of our grandparents and great-grandparents lived the events that turned the ranch into one of America's greatest myths and most 
    enduring architectural styles.</p>
    
  <p class="pBellMTBody">Why does the ranch still have hold over American architecture? Because of the magic of the movies. 
    Building on the tradition of the Wild West shows, movie and television westerns took a rugged, painful, and austere way of life 
    and turned it into a life of romance, adventure, and true grit. They changed a decidedly unromantic and often squalid existence 
    into a shining symbol of individuality, resourcefulness, and contentment.</p>

	<p class="pBellMTBody">As much as the six-shooter and the horse, the ranch house became an emblem of the idealized life. Whether it was an adobe house 
  	from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061619/" target="_blank"><span class="InformalRoman">EL DORADO</span></a> or the log cabin from television's 
    <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052451/" target="_blank"><span class="InformalRoman">BONANZA</span></a>, the lone homestead, a bastion against a forbidding 
    landscape of awesome mountains, desert, and rivers held a warm hearth and an indomitable community. The ranch house's hand-hewn 
    timber beams communicated self-reliance, simplicity, and lack of pretension.</p>
