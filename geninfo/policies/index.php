  <p>
  We hope we have provided a unique and comfortable atmosphere for your stay.  Our goal is that this little spot in Texas has 
  created a memorable event for you.  Please leave the house and grounds in its original condition so that others may continue 
  to enjoy a true Texas experience.</p>
  <p>
	The mementos, artifacts, antiques, photos, and Texas memorabilia are of value to the family of the Lazy U Ranch.  Do not wear 
  the hats, touch the mementos and photos, or handle the guns, etc.  Everything in the house has been documented via video camera 
  and is inspected after each stay.</p>
  <p>All artifacts found on ranch are exclusively property of the ranch.</p>
  <p>
	Please keep in mind that this is a working ranch, and the owners are often working on the premises, and may drop in at any time. 
  Grounds maintenance around lodge by ranch personnel starts at 10:30am week days only.</p>
  <p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Local Game Wardens frequent the property.  If you are fishing in the river make sure you have a license, 
  and be sure to have proper lifejackets for boats! <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/">www.tpwd.state.tx.us</a></p>
