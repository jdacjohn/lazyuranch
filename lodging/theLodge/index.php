	<h1>The Lazy U Lodge</h1>
  <p><strong><?php include("rDeluxe3.php"); ?>, As It is Known in South Texas</strong> was built of beautifully hand varnished knotty pine wood walls, oak and 
  long leaf red pine flooring. A classic ranch house that shows the adaptations and innovations that make the ranch house an 
  ever-changing type with the first flooring laid in <strong>1939</strong>. 
  </p>
	<p><strong>This <?php include("rDeluxe.php"); ?> Provides a Step Back in Time</strong> with a complete 
  <?php include("museum.php"); ?> of Original Family Memorabilia that include items 
  that date back to 1850's. Everything from vintage collector guns, saddles, vintage photos, rare historical collectibles, arrow 
  heads, Indian tools and much more.  <?php include("entry.php"); ?> through the foyer 
  displaying <?php include("vets.php"); ?> of the ancestral photos of the veterans that served in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and Cold War. You will 
  also have access to one of the best TEXAS book libraries for your reading pleasure.
  </p>
  <p><strong>The Lodge Overlooks 1/4 mile of Privately-Owned River Frontage</strong> known as <?php include("lakePlacid.php"); ?>. 
  The original owner had a vision of a spacious front room view of the river that would allow comfort with cool breezes in the summer. 
  The <?php include("porch.php"); ?> offers a spectacular view with over 20 feet of solid pane glass
  providing a magnificent view of the river and meadows – <?php include("viewing_room.php"); ?>
	</p>
  <p><strong>Providing 2000 Square Feet of Living Space</strong> with master bedroom 
  <?php include("eljefe.php"); ?> and (2) guest bedrooms with adjoining 
  bathroom and shower. The house's south side bedroom, <?php include("rios.php"); ?>, provides a 
  full bed with adjoining bath. In the middle of the house is the <?php include("stockyard.php"); ?> 
  that doubles as an entertainment/barroom complete with an <?php include("wood_stove.php"); ?> on each side of the 
  room that are <?php include("murphy_beds.php"); ?>.</p>
  
  <p class="bodyQuote">Slide back from the bar if you've had a little too much "who it hit john" 
 	also known as whiskey in Texas, fold down your bed and fall in to it – <strong>a Cowboy's Dream Bed!</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>The Entire Eastside of the House</strong> with the large glass window provides both the living area and <?php include("dining.php"); ?> (27' X 22') with 
  a true sense of the outdoors to be present inside. Use the binoculars on hand to spot 
  <?php include("critters.php"); ?> in the meadow 
  and on the lake all from the comforts of Texas-Size lazy chairs inside the house. You will find a 
  fully equipped <?php include("kitchen.php"); ?> that offers normal appliances, utensils and other incidentals.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Additional Features</strong> of this extraordinary <?php include("rDeluxe2.php"); ?> include king bed 
  in the master bedroom, central heating and A/C, and wood-burning stoves. The nature trails include 6.5 miles of some of the 
  <?php include("grasslands.php"); ?> pastures complete with a registered herd of 
  <?php include("longhorns.php"); ?> roaming the landscape. As you walk the trails 
  you will pass by <?php include("water_tanks.php"); ?> that provide habitat to a host of varied species 
  of <?php include("ducks.php"); ?>.
  </p> 
  
  <p><strong>At This Time, Ranch Tours</strong> are only offered to overnights guests, and tours must be booked at least five days in advance. While 
  every effort will be made, we make no guarantees that all requests for tours will be met.
  </p>
